               <h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE"> LADY WINDERMERE.</h6> <p class="speech">Why do you _talk_ so trivially about life, then?</p><br>
               <h6 class="LORDDARLINGTON"> LORD DARLINGTON.</h6> <p class="speech"> Because I think that life is far too important a thing
                ever to talk seriously about it.</p><p class="stagedirection">[_Moves up C._]</p><br>

                 <p class="speech"> Ah! you are beginning to reform me.  It
                    is a dangerous thing to reform any one, Lady Windermere.</p><br>

                         How sweet you’re looking!  Where _do_ you get your gowns?  And now I must
                        tell you how sorry I am for you, dear Margaret.</p><br>
