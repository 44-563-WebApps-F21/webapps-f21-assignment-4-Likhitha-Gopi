            <h3>ACT II.       _Drawing-room in Lord Windermere’s
                house_.</h3>

            <p style = "white-space: pre;">
                LADY WINDERMERE.  Lord Darlington is trivial.

                LORD DARLINGTON.  Ah, don’t say that, Lady Windermere.
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  Why do you _talk_ so trivially about life, then?
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  Because I think that life is far too important a thing
                ever to talk seriously about it.  [_Moves up C._]
                
                DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  What does he mean?  Do, as a concession to my poor
                wits, Lord Darlington, just explain to me what you really mean.
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Coming down back of table_.]  I think I had better
                not, Duchess.  Nowadays to be intelligible is to be found out.  Good-bye!
                [_Shakes hands with_ DUCHESS.]  And now—[_goes up stage_] Lady
                Windermere, good-bye.  I may come to-night, mayn’t I?  Do let me come.
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Standing up stage with_ LORD DARLINGTON.]  Yes,
                certainly.  But you are not to say foolish, insincere things to people.
                
                LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Smiling_.]  Ah! you are beginning to reform me.  It
                is a dangerous thing to reform any one, Lady Windermere.  [_Bows_, _and
                exit C._]
                
                DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Who has risen_, _goes C._]  What a charming,
                wicked creature!  I like him so much.  I’m quite delighted he’s gone!
                How sweet you’re looking!  Where _do_ you get your gowns?  And now I must
                tell you how sorry I am for you, dear Margaret.  [_Crosses to sofa and
                sits with_ LADY WINDERMERE.]  Agatha, darling!
                
                LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  [_Rises_.]
                
                DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Will you go and look over the photograph album that
                I see there?
                
                LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  [_Goes to table up L._]
                
                DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Dear girl!  She is so fond of photographs of
                Switzerland.  Such a pure taste, I think.  But I really am so sorry for
                you, Margaret.
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Smiling_.]  Why, Duchess?
                
                DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Oh, on account of that horrid woman.  She dresses so
                well, too, which makes it much worse, sets such a dreadful example.
                Augustus—you know my disreputable brother—such a trial to us all—well,
                Augustus is completely infatuated about her.  It is quite scandalous, for
                she is absolutely inadmissible into society.  Many a woman has a past,
                but I am told that she has at least a dozen, and that they all fit.
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  Whom are you talking about, Duchess?
                
                DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  About Mrs. Erlynne.
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  Mrs. Erlynne?  I never heard of her, Duchess.  And what
                _has_ she to do with me?
                
                DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  My poor child!  Agatha, darling!
                
                LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.
                
                DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Will you go out on the terrace and look at the
                sunset?
                
                LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.
                
                                                             [_Exit through window_, _L._]
                
                DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Sweet girl!  So devoted to sunsets!  Shows such
                refinement of feeling, does it not?  After all, there is nothing like
                Nature, is there?
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  But what is it, Duchess?  Why do you talk to me about
                this person?
