               <h6 class="LADY WINDERMERE"> LADY WINDERMERE.</h6> <p class="speech">Why do you _talk_ so trivially about life, then?</p><br>
               <h6 class="LORD DARLINGTON"> LORD DARLINGTON.</h6> <p class="speech"> Because I think that life is far too important a thing
                ever to talk seriously about it.</p><p class="stagedirection">[_Moves up C._]</p><br>
                <h6 class=" DUCHESS OF BERWICK">  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h6> <p class="speech">What does he mean?  Do, as a concession to my poor
                wits, Lord Darlington, just explain to me what you really mean.</p><br>

                 <p class="speech">  I think I had better
                    not, Duchess.  Nowadays to be intelligible is to be found out.  Good-bye!</p><br>

                 <p class="speech">Lady Windermere, good-bye.  I may come to-night, mayn’t I?  Do let me come.</p><br>
                 <h6 class="LADY WINDERMERE"> LADY WINDERMERE.</h6><p class="stagedirection">[_Standing up stage with_ LORD DARLINGTON.]</p><br>
                 <p class="speech"> Yes, certainly.  But you are not to say foolish, insincere things to people.</p><br>
                 <h6 class="LORD DARLINGTON"> LORD DARLINGTON.</h6><p class="stagedirection">[_Smiling_.]</p><br>
                 <p class="speech"> Ah! you are beginning to reform me.  It
                    is a dangerous thing to reform any one, Lady Windermere.</p><br>

                         How sweet you’re looking!  Where _do_ you get your gowns?  And now I must
                        tell you how sorry I am for you, dear Margaret.</p><br>
